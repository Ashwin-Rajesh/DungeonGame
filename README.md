# DungeonGame

A simple game made in c++, using a simple command-line interface. The objective is to simply find a key in a dungeon, and reach the exit. We can navigate from
room to room, rooms being represneted by letters. There will be potions and enemies to add some interesting events, but overall its really bare-bones and 
admittedly, uninteresting.
